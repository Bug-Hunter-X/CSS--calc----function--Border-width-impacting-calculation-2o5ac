The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `calc()` function: 

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  border: 10px solid black; 
}
```

The issue is that while the `calc()` function intends to dynamically calculate the width, the `border` adds extra width that isn't considered in the calculation. Therefore, the actual rendered width will be smaller than intended. The border contributes to the element's total width. The `100%` width calculation doesn't account for the added border.

This issue is subtle because it doesn't necessarily produce a visible error message; rather, the element's rendered width will deviate unexpectedly from what's specified in the CSS.  This kind of bug becomes more problematic when dealing with responsive designs and complex layouts.
