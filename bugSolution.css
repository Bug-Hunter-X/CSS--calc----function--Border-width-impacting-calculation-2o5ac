The solution involves explicitly accounting for the border width within the `calc()` function:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 40px); /* Subtract double the border width */
  border: 10px solid black;
}
```

This corrected code subtracts the total width added by the border (20px on each side) from the `100%` calculation, ensuring that the rendered width aligns with the intent.
